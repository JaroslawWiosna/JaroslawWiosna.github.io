<h1>Full version</h1>
<h2>1. Our Pledge</h2>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment for everyone, we as contributors and moderators pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Everyone will be welcome in our project and everyones opinion will be respected as long as this person will also behave respectfully. </p><h2>2. Our Standards</h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">•   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</div><div class="line">•   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</div><div class="line">•   Focusing on what is best for the community</div><div class="line">•   Showing empathy towards other community members</div><div class="line">•   Offering help contributors who ask for it</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">•   Annoying trolling, spam, insulting/derogatory comments, vulgar and agresive language towards others</div><div class="line">•   Public or private harassment</div><div class="line">•   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, </div><div class="line">        without explicit permission</div><div class="line">•   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</div></div><!-- fragment --> <h2>3. Our Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Project moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, project changes, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Publishing private data, harrasing people will end with permanent ban instantly. This is place we relax by coding and not focus on personal fights. Punishments for other offenses like spam will be given based on size of it and repeatability. In case when both sides of an argument(where one of the side was harrased/insulted) come to an agreement the punishment might be changed to lower or removed completely. </p><h2>4. Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include posting any information about the project or the community developing it on the internet or behaviour on online and offline meetings with others contributors. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project moderators. If you are not sure you can always write to them with any questions. </p><h2>5. Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project moderators. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Project moderators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership. Current moderators are the authors of this project: Jarosław Wiosna (  ) and Wojciech Mielczarek(  ) In case of any changes in the moderator team the change to this file will be applied. </p>
